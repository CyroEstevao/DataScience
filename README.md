# DATA SCIENCE
## Life Expectancy Prediction Project
#### Objective:
Predict life expectancy based on various health, economic, and social factors.

#### Methods Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Multi-linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Steps Involved:
EDA:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
Visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand distributions and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and encoding categorical variables.
Multi-linear Regression:

Model Building: Split data into training and testing sets, build the regression model.
Evaluation: Use RÂ², MAE, and MSE to assess performance.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Data Standardization: Ensure features are on the same scale.
Model Training: Determine the optimal number of neighbors (k) through cross-validation.
Evaluation: Measure accuracy and other relevant metrics.
Decision Tree:

Model Training: Build the decision tree using selected features.
Pruning: Optimize the tree to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate.
Outcome:
Developed models to predict life expectancy with high accuracy and interpretability, aiding in public health planning and policy-making.

# DATABASE SYSTEM

## Blood Bank Database System Project Using SQL
#### Objective:
Develop and manage a blood bank database to efficiently handle and analyze donor, donation, recipient, and inventory data using SQL and various data manipulation methods.

#### Methods Used:
SQL Data Manipulation
Data Cleaning and Transformation
Aggregations and Joins
Indexing and Query Optimization
Stored Procedures and Triggers
Steps Involved:
Database Design:

Schema Creation: Defined tables for donors, blood donations, recipients, and blood inventory. Established relationships and constraints to model the data accurately.
Normalization: Ensured the database schema was normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Import Data: Loaded data into the database from various sources such as CSV files.
Clean Data: Utilized SQL commands to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types to ensure data quality.
Data Manipulation:

CRUD Operations: Performed Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data within the database.
Data Transformation: Applied SQL functions to format, convert, and manipulate data for better analysis and reporting.
Aggregations and Joins:

Aggregations: Used SQL aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) and GROUP BY clauses to summarize and analyze data.
Joins: Combined data from multiple tables using various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to create comprehensive reports and gain insights.
Indexing and Query Optimization:

Indexing: Created indexes on frequently queried columns to improve the performance of data retrieval operations.
Optimization: Analyzed query execution plans and optimized slow-running queries by refining indexing strategies and query structures.
Stored Procedures and Triggers:

Stored Procedures: Developed reusable SQL scripts encapsulating complex queries and operations to standardize and streamline processes.
Triggers: Implemented triggers to automate actions in response to specific database events, such as updating inventory levels after a new blood donation entry.
Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated the efficient management and analysis of blood bank data using SQL. By employing various SQL techniques, the system provided robust solutions for handling donor information, tracking blood donations, managing recipient data, and maintaining inventory levels. This resulted in improved data integrity, streamlined operations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities for the blood bank.
